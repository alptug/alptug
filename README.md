### Hi there 👋

I am a theoretical & computational physicist by training who loves to research the bridges interconnecting different fields of physics.

- 🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at Debye Institute for Nanomaterial Science, Utrecht University under the supervision of Dr. Laura Filion.
- ⚪️ My research focuses on colloidal self-assembly of quasicrystals and extends to the whole field of statistical physics.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing novel simulation methods and machine learning models to analyse simulation and experimental data.
- 🖥 I'm using C and Python as my main programming languages. Yet, I am always enthusiastic about learning new ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, WGSL and machine learning architechtures.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to theoretical and computational aspects of physics.
